Did I wreck this broken home?\n\n\n\nDear Diary,\n\nLife is trying me.\n\nCan I get a sign?\n\nOr a two of mind, a piece of mind.\n\nCan I get a sign (a sign), can I get a sign (I know)\n\n\n\nWell I know your laying back,\n\nContemplating your own death.\n\nWell just look at what you've done\n\nDon't you dare forget the sun, Love!\n\nYou look down on me so casually, in everything I know.\n\nYou look down on me, but not right on me.\n\nIs it plain to see that life is trying me?\n\n\n\nLife is trying me!\n\nLife is trying.\n\nCan I think of something, gotta think of something!"
