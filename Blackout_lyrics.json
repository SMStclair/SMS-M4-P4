    "lyrics": "How can you heart what you need to hear\nWhen you have never been told you're wrong?\nYou see the world in black and white\nBlind to all color\n\nYOU ARE LOST INSIDE YOUR MIND\n\nTHE WALLS YOU BUILD TO CONFINE MUST RECONCILE\n\nBLACKOUT. AWAKEN IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY\n\nI'M CAUGHT BETWEEN WHO THEY EXPECT ME TO BE\n\nTHE HEART OF AN ANIMAL OR THE MIND OF A MACHINE\n\n\n\nHow can you see what you want to see\n\nIf your eyes haven't been opened at all\n\nI don't have the answers\n\nI just know it's not as simple as right or wrong\n\n\n\nYOU ARE LOST INSIDE YOUR MIND\n\nTHE WALLS YOU BUILD TO CONFINE MUST RECONCILE\n\nBLACKOUT. AWAKEN IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY\n\nI'M CAUGHT BETWEEN WHO THEY EXPECT ME TO BE\n\nTHE HEART OF AN ANIMAL OR THE MIND OF A MACHINE\n\n\n\nNo room for maybe\n\nAfraid of the unknown\n\nSo we rank and file\n\nTo rationalize our existence\n\n\n\nBlackout\n\nAwaken"
