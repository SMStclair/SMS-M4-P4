    "lyrics": "Fellow armsmen, I ask you,\r\nWill you follow me tonight to break their spine,\r\nAnd reclaim what once was mine?\r\nThose cravens.\r\nBackstabbed me, deceived me,\n\nNever shall I tolerate their crimes again,\n\nNow let the hunt begin.\n\n\n\n7000 souls, scared and daunted, such tale of woe,\n\nNot too long ago, this village was a golden\n\nscene of hope.\n\n\n\nCall down the reckoning,\n\nTo bring back hope and peace,\n\nRestore our gloria,\n\nTo live forever.\n\n\n\nBring down the dark regime,\n\nI know how to unleash eternal power,\n\nLead us to order,\n\nI am the Lightbringer!\n\n\n\nFellow warriors, I ask you,\n\nShould my campaign come to an end?\n\nThere's way more to avenge.\n\n\n\n15 million souls,\n\nLiving in this realm without much hope,\n\nNot too long ago, this kingdom was a golden\n\nstate of hope."
